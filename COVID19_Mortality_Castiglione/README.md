========================================================

This project implements a mortality model based on this work:
Filippo Castiglione, Debashrito Deb, Anurag P. Srivastava, Pietro Liò, Arcangelo Liso
bioRxiv 2020.12.20.423670; doi: [10.1101/2020.12.20.423670](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.20.423670)

Additional discussions regarding the mortality model are available in the following mailing lists:
* [Integration subgroup of the multiscale modeling and viral pandemics working group](https://lists.simtk.org/pipermail/vp-integration-subgroup/2020-December/subject.html)
* [Comorbidities subgroup of the multiscale modeling and viral pandemics working group](https://lists.simtk.org/pipermail/vpcomorbidities-subgroup/2020-December/subject.html)



The code is contains the function mortality_prob that can be imported to a python program. 
If executed as a program will generate an interactive plot.


USAGE:
------
* Use `python COVID19_Mortality_Castiglione.py` to generate plot
* Use `import COVID19_Mortality_Castiglione` from within another python program

To view the interactive visualization generated by running this code:
* Download COVID19_Mortality_Castiglione.html
* Open the file with a modern web browser


DEPENDENCIES:
-------------
For plotting, the following libraries are used: panel, bokeh, holoviews


FILES:
------
* COVID19_Mortality_Castiglione.py : Code that generates the function.
* COVID19_Mortality_Castiglione.html : The output plot interactively showing the function
* COVID19_Mortality_Castiglione_Grid.html : The output plot showing the function in grid format
* requirements.txt : specifying requirements of dependent python packages the code was tested with 
* README.MD : the file you are reading now
