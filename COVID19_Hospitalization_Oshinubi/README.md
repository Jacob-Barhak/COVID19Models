COVID-19 Hospitalization Models
===============================

This project implements Hospitalization models as prepared by Kayode Isaac Oshinubi:

# Hospitalization models are as follows:

### Hospitalization Probability
There are 3 models of hospitalization probability as a function of age


### Hospitalization Time Since Infection
There are 3 models of hospitalization time in days since infection as a function of age



### Additional Details

The code contains the hospitalization profiles that can be imported to a python program. 
If executed as a program will generate an interactive plot of all profiles.


USAGE:
------
* Use `python COVID19_Hospitalization.py` to generate plot
* Use `import COVID19_Hospitalization` from within another python program

To view the interactive visualization generated by running this code:
* Download any of these files: COVID19_Hospitalization_Time.html, COVID19_Hospitalization_Prob.html 
* Open the file with a modern web browser


DEPENDENCIES:
-------------
For plotting, the following libraries are used: panel, bokeh, holoviews


FILES:
------
* COVID19_Hospitalization.py : Code that generates the function.
* COVID19_Hospitalization_Time.html : The output plot interactively showing hospitalization probability
* COVID19_Hospitalization_Prob.html : The output plot interactively showing hospitalization time
* requirements.txt : specifying requirements of dependent python packages the code was tested with 
* README.MD : the file you are reading now
