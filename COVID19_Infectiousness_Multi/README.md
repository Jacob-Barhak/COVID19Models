COVID-19 Infectiousness Models from Multiple Sources
====================================================

This project implements infectiousness profiles per day since infection as extracted from multiple sources:

# Infectiousness models are as follows:

### Model 1
Based on Table 1 in:
* Ruiyun Li, Sen Pei, Bin Chen, Yimeng Song, Tao Zhang, Wan Yang, Jeffrey Shaman. Substantial undocumented infection facilitates the rapid dissemination of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2), Science  01 May 2020: Vol. 368, Issue 6490, pp. 489-493. [DOI: 10.1126/science.abb3221](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abb3221) [web link](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/early/2020/03/13/science.abb3221.full.pdf)

The following numbers were extracted:
Min 3.69   Max 3.69 + 3.48 = 7.17  
It was assumed that max infectiousness occurs from start to end except from start and end day in which infectiousness is relative to the portion of the day within the infectiousness period. 

### Model 2
Based on hand digitized figure 3G in:
* Ruian Ke, Carolin Zitzmann, Ruy M. Ribeiro, Alan S. Perelson. Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human upper and lower respiratory tracts and their relationship with infectiousness.  medRxiv 2020.09.25.20201772; [DOI: 10.1101/2020.09.25.20201772](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.25.20201772)

The numbers were digitized manually and processed by scaling the max y to 1 and averaging over 2 points and rounding both x and y  to the closest 1 digits and remove the fractions
Any numbers after day 15 were estimated by eye 

### Model 3
Based on hand digitized figure 3C in:
* Ruian Ke, Carolin Zitzmann, Ruy M. Ribeiro, Alan S. Perelson. Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human upper and lower respiratory tracts and their relationship with infectiousness.  medRxiv 2020.09.25.20201772; [DOI: 10.1101/2020.09.25.20201772](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.25.20201772)

The numbers were digitized manually and processed by scaling the max y to 1 and averaging over 2 points and rounding both x and y  to the closest 1 digits and remove the fractions

### Model 4
Based on hand digitized Figure 2a - blue curve from:
* W.S. Hart, P.K. Maini, R.N. Thompson , High infectiousness immediately before COVID-19 symptom onset highlights the importance of contact tracing. medRxiv 2020.11.20.20235754; [DOI: 10.1101/2020.11.20.20235754](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.20.20235754)

### Model 5
Based on equation 7 from:
* Lucas Bottcher, Mingtao Xia, Tom Chou. Why case fatality ratios can be misleading: individual- and population-based mortality estimates and factors influencing them. Physical Biology, Volume 17, Number 6. [DOI: 10.1088/1478-3975/ab9e59](https://doi.org/10.1088/1478-3975/ab9e59)



### Additional Details

Additional discussions regarding the infectiousness model are available in the following mailing lists:
* Integration subgroup of the multiscale modeling and viral pandemics working group - [Another example of integration and reproduction of a model](https://lists.simtk.org/pipermail/vp-integration-subgroup/2021-January/000012.html)
* Integration subgroup of the multiscale modeling and viral pandemics working group - [Another case study of model integration](https://lists.simtk.org/pipermail/vp-integration-subgroup/2021-March/000044.html)


The code contains the infectiousness profiles that can be imported to a python program. 
If executed as a program will generate an interactive plot of all profiles.


USAGE:
------
* Use `python COVID19_Infectiousness_Multi.py` to generate plot
* Use `import COVID19_Infectiousness_Multi` from within another python program

To view the interactive visualization generated by running this code:
* Download COVID19_Infectiousness_Multi.html
* Open the file with a modern web browser


DEPENDENCIES:
-------------
For plotting, the following libraries are used: panel, bokeh, holoviews


FILES:
------
* COVID19_Infectiousness_Multi.py : Code that generates the function.
* COVID19_Infectiousness_Multi.html : The output plot interactively showing the function
* COVID19_Infectiousness_Grid.html : The output plots in grid format
* requirements.txt : specifying requirements of dependent python packages the code was tested with 
* README.MD : the file you are reading now
